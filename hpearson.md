## About Me
Hello, my name is Halie Pearson, and I am currently working on my second undergraduate degree at the University of North Carolina Greensboro. For those of you who don't know me, here are the top three qualities I would use to describe myself:
    - Inquisitive
    - Athletic
    - Persistent
Just a little bit more about me:
    I have a few hobbies I like to do more regularly which take up most of my free-time, these include:
    - Playing Volleyball (with my partner and friends)
    - Playing Wildrift (mobile version of LoL)
    - Watching anime (excited for the new Demon Slayer Movie coming out soon.) 

## MY CSC-340 Goals
Within the scope of this class I hope to improve my understanding of working with others on a larger scale project as this will be a new experience for me. I also wish to improve my fundamental understanding working with GitHub and collaborating to create a personalized program that attempts to simulate a real life work experience. Learning the important criteria for this course will help pave the way for success in not only further courses, but real life work hopefully in my near future.
