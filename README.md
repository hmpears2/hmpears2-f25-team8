## App Function
1. Customer (the user with the customer role):

     1. Create/modify customer profile - Customers register using email/phone verification and create profiles including home address, property type, preferred contact methods, and service history. Profile management includes photo upload, emergency contact information, and communication preferences accessible through a dedicated "My Profile" section.

     2. View available services - The app displays services through an intuitive category based interface (plumbing, electrical, carpentry, etc.) with search and filter functionality by location radius, availability, pricing, and ratings. Each service listing shows provider details, certifications, sample work photos, and customer reviews.

     3. Subscribe to available services - Customers can book services through an integrated scheduling system that shows real-time availability, allows them to select specific time slots, add project details/photos, and confirm appointments. The system sends automated confirmations and reminders to both parties.
     
     4. Write reviews for subscribed services - After service completion, customers receive automated prompts to rate their experience using a 5-star system with written feedback options. Reviews include categories for punctuality, quality, communication, and value, with photo upload capabilities for before/after documentation. 

2. Provider (the user with the provider role): 

     1. Create/modify/remove provider profile - Service providers complete a comprehensive registration including business license verification, insurance documentation, certifications, and portfolio uploads. They can update availability calendars, service areas, pricing structures, and business information through a provider dashboard. These all get reviewed by real people that have admin access.

     2. Create services - Providers can list multiple service offerings with detailed descriptions, pricing models (hourly/flat rate/estimate-based), required materials, typical project duration, and skill level requirements. Each service can include photo galleries and FAQ sections. These services are limited to blue collar type jobs which is what the app is meant for.

     3. View customer statistics - The provider dashboard displays analytics including booking frequency, revenue tracking, customer demographics, peak service times, and performance metrics compared to platform averages. Reports are available for different time periods with export capabilities. It also alerts to when a potential customer has viewed their page. 

     4. Reply to reviews - Providers can respond to customer reviews through a built-in messaging system, address concerns professionally, thank customers for positive feedback, and demonstrate their commitment to customer service. All responses are public and time-stamped. Reviews are also limited to finished jobs only.
