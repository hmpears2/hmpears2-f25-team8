    ## Description
 
    > HealthCheck Pro is a comprehensive symptom checker web application designed to provide preliminary health assessments to users experiencing medical concerns. The platform enables individuals to create detailed health profiles, complete pre-screening questionnaires about their medical history, and input current symptoms to receive potential diagnosis suggestions and recommended next steps.

    > Motivation: Many people experience uncertainty when symptoms arise and need guidance on whether to seek immediate medical attention, schedule a routine appointment, or try self-care measures. This app bridges the gap between initial symptom onset and professional medical consultation.

    >Goals:
        - Provides accessible, preliminary health assessments 24/7
        - Helps users make informed decisions about seeking medical care
        - Reduces unnecessary emergency room visits for non-urgent conditions
        - Creates a comprehensive health history database for users to share with healthcare providers

    >Problem Solved: The app addresses the common dilemma of symptom uncertainty by offering evidence-based guidance, helping users understand when symptoms require urgent care versus routine medical attention, and providing a structured way to document health concerns over time.

    >App Functions
1. Patient (Primary User Role):

    (1.) Create/modify patient profile - Users register with secure authentication, input demographic information, medical history, current medications, allergies, and emergency contacts through guided forms with validation and privacy controls.

    (1.)Create/modify/remove provider profile - Licensed healthcare professionals can register with credential verification, create detailed profiles including specialties, certifications, and practice information, with ongoing verification requirements and profile management tools.
    (2.)Review and validate assessment algorithms - Providers can access the diagnostic logic, contribute to symptom-condition mappings, review algorithm accuracy, and suggest improvements based on clinical experience and current medical guidelines.
    (3.)Access aggregated health data and trends - The system provides anonymized population health insights, symptom trending data, common assessment patterns, and regional health statistics to support public health initiatives and clinical research.
    (4.)Provide feedback on assessment accuracy - Providers can report on the accuracy of assessments when patients present with app-generated reports, helping to continuously improve the diagnostic algorithms and recommendation systems.

3. SysAdmin (System Administrator Role):

    (1.)Manage user access and authentication - Administrators control user registration approval, manage account permissions, handle password resets, monitor login security, and maintain compliance with healthcare data regulations including HIPAA.
    (2.)Moderate and update medical content - Admins review and approve symptom databases, update diagnostic algorithms based on current medical guidelines, manage condition information accuracy, and ensure content meets clinical standards.
    (3.)Monitor system performance and security - The system provides comprehensive monitoring of application performance, security threat detection, data backup management, and compliance auditing with detailed logging and reporting capabilities.
