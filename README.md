## Description

> HealthCheck Pro is a comprehensive symptom checker web application designed to provide preliminary health assessments to users experiencing medical concerns. The platform enables individuals to create detailed health profiles, complete pre-screening questionnaires about their medical history, and input current symptoms to receive potential diagnosis suggestions and recommended next steps.

>Motivation: Many people experience uncertainty when symptoms arise and need guidance on whether to seek immediate medical attention, schedule a routine appointment, or try self-care measures. This app bridges the gap between initial symptom onset and professional medical consultation.

>Goals:
    - Provides accessible, preliminary health assessments 24/7
    - Helps users make informed decisions about seeking medical care
    - Reduces unnecessary emergency room visits for non-urgent conditions
    - Creates a comprehensive health history database for users to share with healthcare providers

>Problem Solved: The app addresses the common dilemma of symptom uncertainty by offering evidence-based guidance, helping users understand when symptoms require urgent care versus routine medical attention, and providing a structured way to document health concerns over time.

>App Functions
1. Patient (Primary User Role):

(1.) Create/modify patient profile - Users register with basic authentication, input essential demographic information (age, gender) and key medical history through simple forms that integrate easily with third-party medical APIs.
(2.) Complete basic health screening - The app provides a streamlined questionnaire focusing on current symptoms, basic medical history, and medications, using standardized medical terminology that maps directly to API symptom databases.
(3.) Input symptoms and receive assessments - Users select symptoms from a predefined list (sourced from third-party medical APIs), rate severity on simple scales, and receive preliminary assessments generated by external diagnostic APIs with basic care recommendations.
(4.) View assessment results - The platform displays current assessment results in a simple format, with the option to save results locally or export as a basic PDF report for healthcare visits.

2. Healthcare Provider (Simplified Professional Role):

(1.) Create basic provider profile - Licensed healthcare professionals register with minimal verification (license number validation through third-party APIs), creating simple profiles with specialty and contact information.
(2.) Access patient reports - Providers can view patient-generated assessment reports when patients share access codes, allowing them to see symptom inputs and API-generated preliminary assessments without complex data integration.
(3.) Provide simple feedback - The system allows providers to mark assessments as "accurate" or "needs revision" through a basic rating system, with optional text comments that help improve future recommendations.
(4.) View basic usage statistics - Providers can access simple dashboard showing number of patients who shared reports and basic feedback metrics, all generated from straightforward database queries rather than complex analytics.
